Micro Frontends approach POC
    
To run the project use:  
  
```yarn install:All```  
Runs the install in all the modules  
  
```yarn build:all```  
Transpile, creates all the bundles and copy them to the shell public folder  
  
```yarn start```  
Starts the shell server  
  
You could rebuild any micro app and refresh the page to see the changes
